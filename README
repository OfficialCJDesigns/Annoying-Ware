# Annoying Ware

Some of the most annoying C# Scripts you can put in any stub to annoy your victims..

1. Uncloseable Chrome Tab

This is the most fucking obnoxious thing you could ever include in a stub, this will open a link on chrome (if its installed) and will open a new tab every time its closed.
